# Compra Specification

## Purpose

Track product purchases as stock increases with associated expense records integrated into the caja cierre workflow.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Atomic Full-Entity Persistence

The system MUST wrap the purchase creation flow in `IDbContextTransaction`: validate items → create `Compra` (`ID_SUCURSAL`, `ID_PROVEEDOR`, `ID_USUARIO`, `NUMERO_COMPROBANTE`, `TOTAL`, `FECHA_COMPRA`) → create `RenglonCompra` per item → update stock → create `Gasto` linked to active caja → assign `ID_GASTO` back to Compra → single `SaveChanges`. Any failure MUST roll back entirely.

#### Scenario: Transaction rollback on error

- GIVEN a request with 3 items where the third references a non-existent product
- WHEN processed
- THEN no Compra, RenglonCompra, stock changes, or Gasto are persisted
- AND the response returns 400

### Requirement: Proveedor Reference

The request MUST include `proveedorId: int`. The system MUST validate the provider exists before proceeding.

#### Scenario: Invalid proveedor returns 400

- GIVEN a request with `proveedorId: 9999` and no matching Proveedor
- WHEN processed
- THEN returns 400 Bad Request
- AND no data is persisted

### Requirement: User Tracking

The controller MUST extract `userId` from JWT context and set `Compra.ID_USUARIO` via `GetUserId()`.

#### Scenario: Compra stores the authenticated user

- GIVEN an authenticated user with ID 5
- WHEN a purchase is created
- THEN `Compra.ID_USUARIO` equals 5

### Requirement: CompraId in Response

The response MUST include `compraId: int` (the created Compra's primary key).

#### Scenario: Response includes compraId

- GIVEN a successful creation
- WHEN the response is returned
- THEN `compraId` is present and non-zero

### Requirement: Orphan Gasto Strategy

Existing Gastos without an `ID_COMPRA` MUST remain unchanged. New Gastos MUST always have `ID_COMPRA` set (via `Compra.ID_GASTO` foreign key back to Gasto).

#### Scenario: Existing orphan preserved

- GIVEN a Gasto with `ID_COMPRA = NULL` exists from before the change
- WHEN the system runs
- THEN that Gasto is not modified or deleted

### Requirement: Purchase Creation

The system MUST provide a `POST /api/compras/crear` endpoint that creates a purchase — instantiating `Compra` and `RenglonCompra` entities, increasing stock for each item, and recording a single `Gasto` — in one atomic transaction.

The request MUST include `sucursalId`, `proveedorId`, and `items` array. Each item MUST specify `cantidad` and either `productoId` (existing product) or inline creation data (`codigoBarra`, `nombre`). An item MAY include `precio` and `costo` for display or update purposes.

When `productoId` is 0 or omitted, the system MUST create a new product from the inline creation data. When `precio` or `costo` differs from the product's current values, the system MUST update them.
(Previously: used `proveedor: string`, no Compra entity, no atomic transaction; items used `productoId` only; separate `nuevosProductos` array for quick creation; price and cost were not updatable during purchase)

#### Scenario: Full entity creation (updated)

- GIVEN an active caja, an existing proveedor, and existing products
- WHEN POST `/api/compras/crear` includes `proveedorId` and valid items
- THEN a Compra row exists with correct ID_PROVEEDOR, ID_USUARIO, ID_SUCURSAL, TOTAL, FECHA_COMPRA
- AND RenglonCompra rows are created for each item
- AND stock increases
- AND a Gasto is created with ID_COMPRA set
- AND response includes `compraId`

#### Scenario: Creating a purchase with inline-created products

- GIVEN an active caja exists for the sucursal
- WHEN a POST request includes items without `productoId` and with inline creation data
- THEN new products are created from the inline data
- AND their stock increases by the specified cantidad
- AND a Gasto record is created atomically

#### Scenario: Purchase updates price and cost on existing products

- GIVEN a product exists with `precio=100` and `costo=50`
- WHEN an item references that `productoId` with `precio=120` and `costo=60`
- THEN the product's `precio` is updated to 120
- AND the product's `costo` is updated to 60
- AND stock increases normally

### Requirement: Inline Product Creation

The system MUST create a new Producto when an item includes inline creation data (`codigoBarra`, `nombre`) but no `productoId`.

Inline creation data MUST include `codigoBarra` and `nombre`. Fields `precio`, `costo`, and `tamano` MAY be provided; they default to 0 or null when omitted.

The system MUST reject inline creation when `codigoBarra` already exists in the database.

#### Scenario: Minimal inline creation succeeds

- GIVEN an item with no `productoId`, `codigoBarra="NEW001"`, and `nombre="New Product"`
- WHEN the request is processed
- THEN a new Producto is created with the given values
- AND `precio` and `costo` default to 0

#### Scenario: Duplicate barcode returns 409

- GIVEN a Producto exists with `codigoBarra="EXISTING"`
- WHEN an item includes inline creation data with `codigoBarra="EXISTING"`
- THEN the response returns 409 Conflict
- AND no data is persisted

### Requirement: Active Caja Validation

The system MUST reject purchase creation when no caja is open for the sucursal.

#### Scenario: Purchase with no active caja returns 400

- GIVEN no active caja exists for the sucursal
- WHEN a POST request is sent to `/api/compras/crear`
- THEN the response returns 400 Bad Request
- AND the error message indicates "no hay caja abierta"
- AND no stock changes or Gasto records are persisted

### Requirement: Cierre Preview Integration

The `GET /api/caja/{id}/preview-cierre` endpoint MUST include `totalGastos` in the response, computed as the sum of all Gasto amounts linked to that caja.

#### Scenario: Cierre preview shows accumulated gastos

- GIVEN a caja with multiple purchase Gasto records
- WHEN `GET /api/caja/{id}/preview-cierre` is called
- THEN the response includes a `totalGastos` field
- AND its value equals the sum of all Gasto.MONTO for that caja
- AND regular venta totals remain unchanged

### Requirement: Input Validation

The system MUST validate purchase request data and reject malformed input. The request MUST include a valid `proveedorId`.
(Previously: no proveedorId validation; validated `nuevosProductos` array for duplicate barcodes)

#### Scenario: Missing required fields returns 400

- GIVEN a POST request to `/api/compras/crear` with an empty `items` array
- WHEN the request is processed
- THEN the response returns 400 Bad Request
- AND no data is persisted

#### Scenario: Missing proveedorId returns 400

- GIVEN a request without `proveedorId`
- WHEN processed
- THEN returns 400
- AND no data is persisted

#### Scenario: Inline creation missing required fields returns 400

- GIVEN a POST request with an item that has no `productoId`
- AND the item is missing `codigoBarra` or `nombre`
- WHEN the request is processed
- THEN the response returns 400 Bad Request
- AND no data is persisted

### Requirement: Automatic Debt Creation

The system MUST create a Deuda record when a Compra is created. The Deuda links to the Proveedor and the Compra, with the debt amount equal to the compra's total gasto. The debt is created as unpaid within the same database transaction as the compra.

#### Scenario: Purchase creates supplier debt

- GIVEN a compra is created for a proveedor with total $15,000
- WHEN the compra is saved successfully
- THEN a Deuda record is created with MONTO_DEUDA = 15000, ID_PROVEEDOR = the proveedor, ID_COMPRA = the new compra, PAGO = false
