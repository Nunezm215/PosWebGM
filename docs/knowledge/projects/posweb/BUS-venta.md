## Overview

Defines the business rules exclusive to the sales process. These extend `BUS-carrito` — all cart-level rules apply to sales. The rules here are specific to selling products to customers.

---

## Rules

1. **Cash register must be open.** A sale cannot proceed without an active cash register. Verified on entry and re-verified before confirming.

2. **Payment method must be selected.** A sale requires exactly one payment method from the available options.

3. **Change only if the method allows it.** `pagaVuelto` controls whether change is calculated. If the selected method does not pay change, `recibido > total` should not compute change.

4. **Stock is validated before sale.** Items exceeding available stock show a warning and require explicit confirmation to proceed with `allowSinStock`. Stock comparison uses `decimal` to support fractional kg for pesable products.

5. **Partial payment requires a client.** If the amount received is less than the total, a client must be selected to register the debt.

6. **Combos auto-detect when all constituent items are present.** If every item in a combo definition is in the cart with sufficient quantity, they are unified into a single combo line item. Cart operations on combo items must follow the identity contract defined in `PAT-cart-flow`.

7. **Payment methods sorted: Cash first, Transfer second.** `id=1` (Efectivo) and `id=4` (Transferencia) appear before other methods.
